Description: With 'pitchRx2', one can easily obtain Major League Baseball Advanced
    Media's 'Gameday' data. The 'Gameday' website hosts a wealth of data in XML
    format, but perhaps most interesting is 'pitchfx'. Among other things, 
    'pitchfx' data can be used to recreate a baseball's flight path from a pitcher's 
    hand to home plate.
